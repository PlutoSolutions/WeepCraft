our biggest release ever

# [ info ]

A Minecraft 1.4.7 hacked client that released back in January 2013 but later that year it broke due to the author wiping his dropbox uploads or some shit

We fixed that and additionally cracked it so the client thinks that you are a VIP user and adds like 4 useless modules

# [ how-to ]

Get the jar from [releases page](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/WeepCraft/releases) and install [MultiMC](https://multimc.org)

Afterwards make a new 1.4.7 instance and click here
